Adds retina image support to bfi_thumb. 

Instead of creating a single image e.g. your_image.jpg, you'll get a second image called your_image@2x.jpg which is double the size. This gives it compatibility with WP Retina 2x http://apps.meow.fr/wp-retina-2x/

You can change the '@2x' suffix to something different if you prefer.
